          There are many crypto trading bots out there. However, they are made
          for experienced traders and/or tech-savvy people. So, even though they
          are supposed to make trading easier, the truth is, they are very
          complicated.
        </div>
        <div>
          Thatâ€™s why we made EazyBot; to make crypto trading easy and accessible
          to everyone.
